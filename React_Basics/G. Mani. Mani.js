// Class 
// A class is used to bind data as well as methods together as a single unit. 
//Object acts like a variable of the class.

//Arrow
//To write a shorter syntax for the function we use ARROW

//Var
//If we use outside the function its called global variable. 
//If we use inside the function its called local variable.

//Const
//Once we assigned as constant we never change it.

//Let:
//If you use var inside a for loop or any other block. the variable also available outside of that block or loop, 
//So we use "LET" for overcoming from this problem.
//If we use variable as let in block or loop, then the value only available inside the block only.
